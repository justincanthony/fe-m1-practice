## Day 1 Exercises

1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

 - Hyper text markup language is the framework for which websites are built. It allows for a website to be viewed and holds the programming languages inside of it in order to be interpreted. It describes the structure and format of the website/page.

2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?

 - element: a set of opening and closing tags that tell the browser something about the information that sits between the opening and closing tags.
 - tag: used to markup the beginning and end of an element

3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

 - attributes: indicate what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. it defines the property of an element and is assigned a `name = value` pair in the element's start tag and is seperated by an equals sign. The name is written in lowercase. The value is wrapped in double quotes. most attributes are predefined or follow a stipulated format. __HTML 5 allows for uppercase attribute names and omitting quotes, but it is not recommended__

 4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

  - Head: is a container for meta data. it contains information about the page (rather than information shown within the main browser window). You will usually find the `<title>` element within the `<head>`.
  - Title: is a tag that contains text to be viewed in the browser's title or page's tab

  - Body:the second element in an html document. there can only be one. it represents the content of the document and is what is shown in the browser window.

 5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

  -  ( cmd + opt + u) or right click view source

 6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

  - <h1> heading element </h1>
  - <b>  bold </b>
  - <i> _italics_ </i>
  - this is <sup>superscript<sup>superduperscript</sup></sup><sub>subscript</sub>
  <br></br> or `<br />`

  <hr />

 7.  What are empty elements?

 - elements that do not have any words between the opening and closing tag like break or horizontal rule

8.  What is semantic markup?

 - text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of the web page but add extra information to the pages. They should not be used to alter the text, but describe the content of your webpages more accurately. Other programs, such as screen readers or search engines can read this extra information and interpret it differently. `<em>` will be read differently by the voice of a screen reader.

9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

 - headers and footers: used for main header and footer for the top and bottom of page or as a header/footer for a section or an article within a page  
 - nav: navigation element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site
 - article: a container for any section of the page that could stand alone and be syndicated(article/blog post/ comment or forum post) articles can live within articles as well.
 - asides: can be used in two ways. in an article and out of an article. when in: it can contain a glossary or pull quote. when outside of an article, it is used to contain information about the whole page (links to other sections/searchbox/list of recent articles)
